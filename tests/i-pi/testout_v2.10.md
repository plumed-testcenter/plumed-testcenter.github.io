Testing i-pi
------------------------
 
The tests described in the following tables were performed on __November 24, 2025__ to test whether the interface between i-pi and the v2.10 version of PLUMED is working correctly.

WARNING: You can run multiple systems with different timesteps that all use the same PLUMED driver with i-Pi. The timestep that is passed from i-Pi to PLUMED is thus always one. The time column in any output file generated by PLUMED when it is running with i-Pi does not tell you how much time has elapsed since the start of the calculation.

WARNING: Masses and charges are not passed from i-pi to PLUMED. You thus cannot use features with this code that rely on masses and charges for the atoms being provided.  For example, you cannot use COM.
