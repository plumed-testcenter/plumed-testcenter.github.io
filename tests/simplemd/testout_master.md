Testing simplemd
------------------------
 
The tests described in the following tables were performed on __November 02, 2025__ to test whether the interface between simplemd and the master version of PLUMED is working correctly.

WARNING: simplemd does not pass the virial to PLUMED and it is thus not possible to run NPT simulations with this code
