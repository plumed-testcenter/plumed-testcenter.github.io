name: i-pi
description: A universal force engine interface that can be used to sample thermodynamic
  ensembles once it is coupled with a function for calculating the energies and forces
executible: i-pi
tolerance: 0.001

tests:
  positions: true
  timestep: true
  mass: false
  charge: false
  forces: false
  virial: true
  energy: true
  engforces: true
warning:
- You can run multiple systems with different timesteps that all use the same PLUMED
  driver with i-Pi. The timestep that is passed from i-Pi to PLUMED is thus always
  one. The time column in any output file generated by PLUMED when it is running with
  i-Pi does not tell you how much time has elapsed since the start of the calculation.
- Masses and charges are not passed from i-pi to PLUMED. You thus cannot use features
  with this code that rely on masses and charges for the atoms being provided.  For
  example, you cannot use COM.
